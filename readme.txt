Easily embed a product on Fancy into your posts.

== Description ==

[Fancy](http://fancy.com) is the place where you discover amazing stuff, collect the things you love, and buy it all in one place. You can easily embed any product on Fancy into your WordPress blog and enable your visitors to buy it directly on your blog. Plus, you will earn credits when they purchase!


= Embedding with a Shortcode =

Copy the URL of the thing you’d like to embed. Then create a shortcode using the format below. Be sure to replace the URL listed here with the URL of the thing, and the code is on a line by itself.

`[fancy thing="http://fancy.com/things/190403263978277559/Fancy-Box-Subscription"]`

To change the size of the image, for example to set the width of the image to 300 pixels, you would use the following shortcode:

`[fancy thing="http://fancy.com/things/190403263978277559/Fancy-Box-Subscription" width=300]`

Fancy automatically resizes the height to keep the image ratio.
